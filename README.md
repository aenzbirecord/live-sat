Here is a simple Bash script to detect devices communicating on your network, including potential satellite links or unknown IPs. This uses nmap to perform a network scan and list active hosts. It won't specifically detect satellites but can show connected devices that may use satellite links.

Script: satellite_scan.sh

#!/bin/bash

# Check if nmap is installed
if ! command -v nmap &> /dev/null
then
    echo "nmap could not be found. Installing..."
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y nmap
fi

# Set the network range (replace with your network range)
NETWORK="192.168.1.0/24"

echo "Scanning network $NETWORK for live hosts..."
nmap -sn $NETWORK | grep "Nmap scan report" | awk '{print $5}' > live_hosts.txt

echo "Live hosts detected:"
cat live_hosts.txt

# Identify non-local IP addresses (possible satellite or external links)
echo "Checking for non-local IPs..."
while IFS= read -r ip; do
    whois $ip | grep -E "netname|descr|country|OrgName"
done < live_hosts.txt

echo "Scan complete. Check live_hosts.txt for full results."

How it Works:

Nmap scans the network to detect live devices.

The script saves IPs of live hosts to live_hosts.txt.

It uses whois to check details about each IP, helping identify external IPs.

Any IPs that donâ€™t match the local network might be monitored or satellite-linked.

Usage:

1. Save the script as satellite_scan.sh.


2. Give it execution permissions:

chmod +x satellite_scan.sh


3. Run the script:

./satellite_scan.sh

Notes:

Replace 192.168.1.0/24 with your actual network range.

This script won't directly identify satellites but will reveal external/unknown devices.

You can add more filters to whois or nmap options to increase accuracy.
